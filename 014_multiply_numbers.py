# So far we've seen functions that take only one input. They can actually take
# two, or even more, inputs. Take a look at this:

# Notice two parameters with a comma between them
def multiply_numbers(num_a, num_b):
  return num_a * num_b # That `*` means multiply

# And let's use it:

print("multiply_numbers(2, 3) is:")
print(multiply_numbers(2, 3))

print("multiply_numbers(3, 5) is:")
print(multiply_numbers(3, 5))

# @TASK: Run these in the terminal using:

#   python 014_multiply_numbers.py

# Now move on to 015_add_numbers.py to write your own.
