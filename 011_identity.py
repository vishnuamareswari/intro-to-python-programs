# Start reading here:

def just_return_it(num):
  return num

# This is a function. A function is a reusable block of code.

# Think of a function as a little machine. It takes an input, processes it in
# some way, and then returns an output.

# This `just_return_it` function has:

# * A name: `just_return_it` that we can use to call it

# * A parameter: `num` that it takes as input. You might also hear these
#   informally referred to as 'arguments'

# * A body: `return num` that processes the input and returns the result as
#   output. Python uses spaces at the start of each line to indicate what's the
#   body and what isn't

# `just_return_it` is a very simple function, it doesn't do very much. It takes
# a piece of data as input, and returns it as output.

# We call a function like this:

just_return_it(4)
# Returns 4

# In the code above, the argument `4` goes into the `just_return_it` function
# and takes the place of `num` in the function body.

# Want to see? Here, we can use `print` to show you:

print("just_return_it(4) returns:")
print(just_return_it(4))

# @TASK: Run this program in the bottom terminal panel:
#
#   python 011_identity.py
#

# If you don't see the terminal, watch this video:
# https://vimeo.com/1061335416/4f5eb4a48f
#
# After running the command, you should see:
#
# ```
# just_return_it(4) returns:
# 4
# ```
#
# This shows us that when we call the `just_return_it` function with the input
# parameter `4` â€” it gives us `4` back.
#
# Now move on to 012_add_one.py
