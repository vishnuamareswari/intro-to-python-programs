# Now, let's look at statements. You've already seen a few of these too:

added = 2 + 3

# Is this a statement? Yes!
#
# That statement uses the `=` operator to assign the result of the expression on
# the right (`2 + 3`) to the name on the left (`added`).
#
# It's called a statement because it changes the 'state' of the program.
#
# What's the state of a program? Let's take a look at an example.

my_favourite_number = 99

print(f"My favourite number is: {my_favourite_number}")
print("---")

# Here's the state of the above program after all lines are executed:
#
# | Name                | Value |
# | ------------------- | ----- |
# | my_favourite_number | 99    |
#
# We can refer to things in the state of the program by name.
#
# These names — `my_favourite_number` — are typically called 'variables'. This
# is because the names stay the same, but the values assigned to them can vary.
#
# Look at this program:

todays_day = 19
todays_day = 20

print(f"Today's day is: {todays_day}")
print("---")

# @TASK: What will it print? Run this file and find out.
#
# You'll see that the first `19` value is thrown away and replaced with the
# second `20` value.

# When you're ready, move on to 019_state.py
